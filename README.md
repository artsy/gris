# Gris

Gris is a framework for building Rack-based hypermedia APIs using Grape, Roar and ActiveRecord.

[![Build Status](https://semaphoreci.com/api/v1/projects/37371083-45b6-4c6f-a887-b631ca0fbe5c/381675/badge.png)](https://semaphoreci.com/dylanfareed/gris)

It is derived from/inspired by the stellar and more sophisticated [Napa framework by Bellycard Inc.](https://github.com/bellycard/napa).

Gris aims to provide generators and middleware common to API microservices. For the moment, however, it is in development and primarily exploratory. Note that the ground may shift.
