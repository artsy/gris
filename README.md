# Gris

Gris is a framework for building Rack-based hypermedia APIs using Grape, Roar and ActiveRecord.

[![Build Status](https://semaphoreci.com/api/v1/projects/aeb68b19-58b7-4015-885d-e989a3e96ca2/418227/badge.svg)](https://semaphoreci.com/artsy/gris)

It is derived from/inspired by the stellar and more sophisticated [Napa framework by Bellycard Inc.](https://github.com/bellycard/napa).

Gris aims to provide generators and middleware common to API microservices. For the moment, however, it is in development and primarily exploratory. Note that the ground may shift.
